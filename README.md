But if we do so it does not work above a package statement
```bash
gradle build
```

gives
```
e: /Users/brandl/projects/kotlin/misc/file_pckg_annot/src/main/kotlin/com/foobar/WithPckg.kt: (2, 7): Unresolved reference: MyAnno

## orignal problem


![](.README_images/1af75ba8.png)

It seems to work only for stdlb annotations and not for annotations added via classpath. IJ seems aware of the existence because itâ€™s showing an import popup, but there should be no need to import since the `DependsOn` annotation is declared on toplevel as is

This repo contains a SSCE to illustrate the issue.
